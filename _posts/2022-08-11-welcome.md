title: Introducing VirtualHub Blog
---

Welcome to the VirtualHub Blog. This blog has been created to record my continued struggle for finding a perfect CMS/SSG for the VirtualHub website. Until now, I have used Wordpress, CloudCanon and Publii. None of them proved to be the tool I have dreamt of.

Now I am trying Jekyll. This blog is generated using it. Stay tuned and you can access an early insight to the VirtualHub website powered by Jekyll.

I will continue posting different stories about what I am planning to do with the VirtualHub and Legacy Installer sites and other projects that I think of.

Stay tuned!
