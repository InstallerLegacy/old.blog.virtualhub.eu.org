Do not worry! I am not going to start the VirtualHub website from scratch once again. Instead, this post is about the Operating System I use. I plan to start blogging everything I do related to VirtualHub from start, from installing the opperating system.

My plan is to installl a total of 5 operating systems:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Default Gnome edition)
- Ubuntu 20.04 (Default Gnome edition)
- Ubuntu 22.04 (Default Gnome edition)
- Debian Testing (with KDE)
- Fedora Workstation (Default Gnome edition)

I will update Ubuntu 22.04 and Kubuntu 22.04 to 22.10 when the update comes. I will post about all of these - how I install them, configure them, and make them usable.

I am going to use Ubuntu 22.04 as my main operating system while using others to create tutorials occasionally.

I have been thinking about doing this for a long time. I will also probably upload videos on youtube, but no promise. Here is a picture for you:

Stay tuned!
